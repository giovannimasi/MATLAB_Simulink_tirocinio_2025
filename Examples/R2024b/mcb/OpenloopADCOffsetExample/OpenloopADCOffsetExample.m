%% Run 3-Phase AC Motors in Open-Loop Control and Calibrate ADC Offset
% This example uses open-loop control (also known as scalar control or
% Volts/Hz control) to run a motor. This technique varies the stator
% voltage and frequency to control the rotor speed without using any
% feedback from the motor. You can use this technique to check the
% integrity of the hardware connections. A constant speed application of
% open-loop control uses a fixed-frequency motor power supply. An
% adjustable speed application of open-loop control needs a
% variable-frequency power supply to control the rotor speed. To ensure a
% constant stator magnetic flux, keep the supply voltage amplitude
% proportional to its frequency.
% 
% Open-loop motor control does not have the ability to consider the
% external conditions that can affect the motor speed. Therefore, the
% control system cannot automatically correct the deviation between the
% desired and the actual motor speed. 
% 
% This model runs the motor by using an open-loop motor control algorithm. The model helps you get started with Motor Control Blockset(TM) and verify the hardware setup by running the motor. The target model algorithm also reads the ADC values from the current sensors and sends these values to the host model by using serial communication.
% 
% You can use this model to:
% 
% * Check connectivity with the target.
% * Check serial communication with the target.
% * Verify the hardware and software environment.
% * Check ADC offsets for current sensors.
% * Run a new motor with an inverter and target setup for the first time.

%% Generate Code and Deploy Model to Target Hardware
% This section instructs you to generate code and run the motor by using open-loop control.
% 
% The example uses a host and a target model. The host model is a user interface to the controller hardware board.  You can run the host model on the host computer. The prerequisite to use the host model is to deploy the target model to the controller hardware board. The host model uses serial communication to command the target Simulink(R) model and run the motor in a closed-loop control.
%

% 
% *2.* Update the gain Correction_Factor_sinePWM as 20%.
% 
% *3.* For safety reasons, regularly monitor the motor shaft, motor current, and motor temperature.

%
% *1.* Simulate the target model and observe the simulation results.
% 
% *2.* Complete the hardware connections.
% 
% *3.* Open the target model for the hardware configuration that you want to use. If you want to change the default hardware configuration settings for the target model, see <docid:mcb_gs#mw_3286e9a5-4b65-4b84-9133-a92130b252bc Model Configuration

% program that operates the CPU2 blue LED by using GPIO31 (c28379D_cpu2_blink.slx), to ensure that CPU2 is not mistakenly configured to use the board peripherals intended for CPU1. For more information about the sample program (model), see the Task 2 - Create, Configure and Run the Model for TI Delfino F28379D LaunchPad (Dual Core) section in <docid:c2b_ug#mw_4dc3a55d-e3bc-4773-a16c-67d60b5331bb Getting Started with Texas Instruments C2000 Microcontroller Blockset>.

% 
% *8.* Select a target (either |TI F28069M|, |TI F28379D|, or |Other|) in the *Target Selection* area of the host model.
% 
% *NOTE:* If you select |Other|, you can enter the *Baud rate* for the
% target hardware that you are using, in the Host Serial Setup block
% parameter dialog box.
% 
% *9.* In the host model, open the blocks Host Serial Setup, Host Serial
% Receive, and Host Serial Transmit, and select a Port.
% 
% *10.* Enter the Reference Speed value in the host model.
%  
% *11.* Click *Run* on the *Simulation* tab to run the host model.
% 
% *12.* Change the position of the Start / Stop Motor switch to On, to start running the motor.
% 
% *13.* After the motor is running, observe the ADC counts for the ${I_a}$ and ${I_b}$ currents in the Time Scope.
% 
% *NOTE:* This example may not allow the motor to run at full capacity. Begin running the motor at a small speed. In addition, it is recommended to change the Reference Speed in small steps (for example, for a motor having a base speed of 3000 rpm, start running the motor at 500 rpm and then increase or decrease the speed in steps of 200 rpm).
% 
% If the motor does not run, change the position of the Start / Stop Motor switch to Off, to stop the motor and change the Reference Speed in the host model. Then, change the position of the Start / Stop Motor switch to On, to run the motor again.
% 
% *Generate Code and Run Model to Calibrate ADC Offset*
% 
% *1.* Simulate the target model and observe the simulation results.
% 
% *2.* Complete the hardware connections.
% 
% *3.* Disconnect the motor wires for three phases from the hardware board terminals.

% corrections for the currents ${I_a}$ and ${I_b}$. To obtain the average
% (median) values of ADC counts:
% 
% * In the *Scope* window, navigate to *Tools* > *Measurements* and select
% *Signal Statistics* to display the *Trace Selection* and *Signal
% Statistics* areas.
% 
% <<../mcb_open_loop_scope.png>>
%

% Statistics* pane. You can see the median value of the selected signal in
% the Median field.
